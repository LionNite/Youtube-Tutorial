   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LionNite/Youtube-Tutorial.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

## Usage

Once you have installed the bot, you can start it by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration

Before you start trading, you need to configure the bot with your API keys and trading preferences. Open the `config.json` file and enter your exchange API keys. Hereâ€™s a sample configuration:

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "api_secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET",
  "trading_pair": "BTC/USD",
  "strategy": "arbitrage"
}
```

### Starting the Bot

After configuring the bot, you can run it. The bot will start monitoring the market and executing trades based on your selected strategy.

## Trading Strategies

This bot supports multiple trading strategies. Here are some of the strategies you can implement:

### 1. Arbitrage

Arbitrage trading involves buying and selling the same asset on different exchanges to profit from price differences. The bot can automatically execute trades to capitalize on these opportunities.

### 2. Trend Following

This strategy involves analyzing market trends and making trades based on the direction of the trend. The bot can identify upward or downward trends and execute trades accordingly.

### 3. Mean Reversion

Mean reversion strategies assume that asset prices will revert to their historical average. The bot can identify overbought or oversold conditions and make trades based on these signals.
